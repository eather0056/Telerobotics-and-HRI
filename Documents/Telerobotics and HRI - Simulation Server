Lab 1 Submission: Telerobotics and HRI - Simulation Server

This submission contains the project developed for Lab 1 in the Telerobotics and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) course. The project involves setting up a simulation server using Unity and ROS for teleoperating an underwater robot (BlueRov). The environment includes a custom-designed pool scene with realistic water simulation using Unity's High Definition Rendering Pipeline (HDRP). The integration with ROS allows for real-time teleoperation and data exchange between Unity and ROS nodes.
